# Data

This folder contains all the raw UTMB results files used in the project.

We focus only on the years 2017 to 2025 because earlier editions are either not available through the official API or lack consistent formatting. From 2017 onwards, the data structure is more standardized and includes essential information such as finish times, rankings, gender, nationality, and age group.

Each file follows the naming convention:  
**utmb_<YEAR>_results.csv**

These files are fetched using the official UTMB API and stored in this folder for further analysis.
